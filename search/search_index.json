Perception","text":"<p>What It Is: Perception is the agent\u2019s ability to gather information about its environment.

Reasoning","text":"<p>What It Is: Reasoning is where the agent makes sense of the information it has perceived. This involves interpreting context, weighing different options, and forming logical conclusions. Why It Matters: Reasoning underpins an agent\u2019s intelligence.

Memory","text":"<p>What It Is: Memory is the agent\u2019s way of retaining relevant information over time. This can include short-term context (like the last user request) and long-term knowledge (like a database of past interactions or general industry expertise).

Planning","text":"<p>What It Is: Planning is where the agent decides what steps to take to achieve its goals. It might break down complex tasks into simpler steps, sequence them in an optimal order, and anticipate potential roadblocks. Why It Matters: Planning ensures that the agent isn\u2019t just reacting to one request at a time, but proactively charting a path towards longer-term objectives. This is crucial for tasks like supply chain optimization, project management, or any scenario where actions taken now have future implications.</p>"},{"location":"course/day-3/#5-action","title":"5. Action","text":"<p>What It Is: Finally, action is the actual execution of the agent\u2019s decisions\u2014sending an email, adjusting inventory levels, recommending a product, or performing a system-level operation.

Function calling allows your LLM to seamlessly integrate with external tools and APIs:</p> <ol> <li>Structured Output: Instead of returning just free-form text, LLMs can respond with structured function calls\u2014like a JSON object containing parameters. This ensures that outputs are machine-readable and reduces ambiguity, allowing your agent to parse results reliably and consistently.</li> <li>Dynamic Behavior: With function calling, your agent can dynamically decide which external functions or APIs to use based on user queries. For example, if a user asks for today\u2019s weather, the LLM can \u201ccall\u201d the appropriate weather API automatically, retrieve fresh data, and incorporate it into its response.</li> <li>Safe and Controlled Execution: By defining which functions are available to the agent, you control what actions the LLM can trigger. This creates a sandboxed environment where the LLM\u2019s capabilities are guided and restricted, improving reliability, security, and safety.</li> </ol> <p>There\u2019s a lot of innovation in the Tool Calling space, which will unlock real autonomous actions by AI and developers can easily create new tools to add into a catalog.</p> <p> </p> <p>Integrating function calling into your LLM-based agent transforms the agent from a passive respondent into an active problem-solver\u2014one that not only processes language but also performs tasks and retrieves information on-demand. </p> <p>So, which LLM is best for Function Calling?

Tracking Token Usage per Interaction, Latency per Tool Call, and Tool Selection Accuracy helped the agent adapt its analysis patterns, accelerate processing, and use the right tool for the right task. The result: Faster prospect qualification, higher accuracy, and better resource utilization.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"course/day-7/#from-simple-metrics-to-sophisticated-judging-paradigms","title":"From Simple Metrics to Sophisticated Judging Paradigms","text":"<p>As we refine metrics, it\u2019s also essential to consider who or what \u201cjudges\u201d agent performance:</p> <ul> <li>LLM-as-a-Judge: Quick but surface-level evaluation based on pattern recognition.
